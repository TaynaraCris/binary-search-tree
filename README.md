# binary-search-tree

The objetive of this project is to receive an .csv file with integers and generate a Binary Search Tree(BST) and calculate the balance factor for every node.
In the end of the program, we should be able to print the BST in crescent order.

Balance factor = Height_left_subtree - height_right_subtree
